When people think of remote working the exotic comes to mind. Beaches and sunsets. Eating new foods for the first time. Wine tasting all over the world. Working from mountain tops or white sand beaches. Surfing before breakfast. Taking lots of photos and blogging to your thousands of followers all over the world.

All those things have very little to do with remote working. Remote working isn’t the destination it’s a way of life. While I enjoy new and old destinations my work is separate of those things. How can this be? It’s because I don’t work remotely to check off countries off my bucket list and indulge as much as I want. I can do those things because I work remotely. The choice is mine. If I wasn’t traveling would I go back into the office? Never.

My lifestyle is that I can work from anywhere in the world WITH good wifi. I leave the less than desirable wifi locations for when I take a vacation. When people ask what I do that I get to travel so much I tell them it’s not that I travel for work. I work and because I am remote I can travel whenever I choose. I don’t need to wait for vacation or take leave of any kind.

The difference in mindset is that I value my time, my family, and my services. I don’t have time to be stuck in traffic and commute hours out of my day every day. There was once a time when I did and it was part of my lifestyle. I didn’t think it could be any different and I didn’t necessarily want it to be. I was once with my family consistently. My children slept under the same roof and we spent weekends together. This is also no longer the case and I want to choose them and the rest of my family first. I’ve been able to be with family in good and bad situations and own that time.  My services don’t require me to be in person. Period.

I used to believe that I what I offered could only be fully appreciated in person. How could anyone know my value if they couldn’t see it? How could I convince myself of the same? I had to try it.
