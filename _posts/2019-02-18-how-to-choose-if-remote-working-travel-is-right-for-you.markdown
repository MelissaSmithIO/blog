I get asked often how to choose if working remotely and traveling at the same time is right for everyone. Are there certain positions that someone could have and be better off working from home, a co-working space, traveling, or become completely nomadic?

I’m not sure when or who decided that a choice had to be made to do one or the other. Or that somehow by making a decision you wouldn’t be able to change your mind again later. That’s the great thing about remote working. You get to make choices. Choices for options you didn’t have while you worked in an office.
The power of choice can be overwhelming. I get overwhelmed when I go out to eat and there are dozens of options and combinations. Plus, most of them seem to be generic and not very appetizing. I would much rather go to a place known for certain meals or with menus only one page long. It allows me to quickly know if I want to eat there and what I want to eat. The other thing it does is create excitement.

Your decisions should be right for you. Of course, if you are employed and/or have clients that is a factor to keep in mind but you have to decide what is best for you, first. The feeling of excitement should quickly follow. That might sound obvious, but it's not. Travel isn't exciting for everyone.

You also shouldn’t be driven by making the right decisions all the time. That will drive you mad. We’ve all made bad choices. Sometimes it is as small as ordering the wrong the meal and sometimes much bigger decisions like taking a job that was all wrong for you and staying with the wrong partner.

Nothing is permanent. Good or bad. Life is constantly changing. What is right for you today may not be what is right for you next month or next year. When making choices what you are really doing is giving yourself permission to choose knowing that you could be wrong and then figure out how to make things right.

If you knew one hundred percent you were making the right decision the power of choice wouldn’t be scary or exciting. Nor would it be so rewarding.
There are mistakes you can make when choosing to travel while remote working. Watch the video below for the three most common mistakes remote workers make when deciding to add travel to their daily lives along with work and how to avoid them.
