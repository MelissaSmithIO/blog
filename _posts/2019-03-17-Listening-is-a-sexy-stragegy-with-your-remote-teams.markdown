Last week I posted an article that discussed how [*Leading Remote Teams Is A Centuries-Old Concept*](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leading-remote-teams-centuries-old-concept-melissa-smith/). Which means there have been remote leaders for just as long. If you are a good leader there is no need to change your leadership style specifically to try and be a better leader for those who are remote. Instead, your greatest strength as a leader will be knowing when (which is always before you *need* to) change your medium of communication.

While there is no shortage of duties you take on as a leader I would challenge you to believe none is greater than not only predicting the future but shaping it. Nothing shapes the future quite like how we communicate with one another.

You, as the leader, can’t possibly do everything on your own. You lead teams for a reason which is exactly where you need to begin, with your team. I don’t like to refer it as leading from the bottom and being a top-down leader will get you nowhere. Look at the communication you’re already putting forth with that verbiage. You can flip it any way you like to make it sound better for yourself but it won't sound any better to your team.

What you probably already know is that not everyone can be the leader. Here’s what you must understand - not everyone *wants* to be the leader. You employ many people who would never want your job. What they want is to be the best at their job.

Your employee's great gift to you is being the eyes and ears of the company. Working with users and clients and having real conversations. Doing the work they love to support the company’s mission and vision of the future. Your greatest downfall will not come because you weren’t able to deliver *your* message to the company or team. The downfall will come when your team and employees can’t get a message to you.

As leaders, you might preach that you are only as strong as your weakest link but in business, you’re only as strong your poorest communicator. The one holding the wealth of knowledge and doesn’t even know it.

Your company's communication strategy isn’t just how *you* get to communicate, but most importantly how you get to listen. I hear often the ways that companies offer employees at all levels to provide feedback. Almost every instance is in the manner that is convenient for the leader of the team to receive it which is backward. Furthermore, there is rarely sincere acknowledgment for what the employees share.

The reason your employees are holding onto a wealth of knowledge is that they don’t know you well enough to share and they don't understand the company's real needs to realize they just might have the answer.

Answers don’t always present themselves in clear form. Sometimes they need tweaking and adjustments. It’s not even the same as finding the needle in the haystack because in that scenario you know what you are looking for, it’s simply hard to find. In this scenario what you want is what I like to call that thing that is “pleasantly out of place”.

Now before I write another article on that subject lets circle back to listening. There is nothing quite like being in the presence of a good listener. In fact, it’s such a rare leadership quality that when such a person demonstrates the ability it can be hard to notice what you are witnessing.

For instance, it is easy to see someone speak and know she is a great speaker. It’s easy to notice great writing and even great decision-making skills. However, being in the presence of a great leader who listens can be overwhelming because the person being listened to is often in awe. He may be trying to say the right things knowing he has a captive audience or nervous because someone whom he respects is respecting him. It becomes a real interaction unlike listening to a speaker or reading your favorite author.

I met a great leader, Chris Dyer, in May 2018 at the Remote Work Summit in Guatemala. He is, in fact, also a great writer and speaker. However, for the longest time, I didn't know why I was drawn to him as a leader. All I knew (and still know) is that Chris is the type of CEO I strive to be. He just seemed to have the "it" factor. Almost a year later I discovered what the "it" is. Chris is a leader with incredible listening skills and has the company, team, and accolades to prove it.

Recently, Chris held a webinar called [“Listening Is Sexy”](https://peopleg2.com/peopleg2-webinars/). In the webinar, he explains why listening is underrated as a sexy tool and you’ll learn some excellent strategies he uses with his team. You can't afford not to listen to this webinar.

If you really want to be a better leader, build a better company, and implement proper communication listening must be a part of the strategy.
