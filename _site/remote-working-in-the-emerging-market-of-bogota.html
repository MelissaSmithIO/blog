      <p>When I first signed up for We Roam and decided to be location independent, work and travel in 12 countries in 12 months, the list of countries excited me. Well, mostly. If ever anyone asked what destination I was least looking forward to I would mention Bogota, Colombia.</p>

<p>Everything I ever knew about Colombia or Bogota came from watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088011/">Romancing the Stone</a> or documentaries on the drug lords. Neither of which prepared me for the city where I would live and work for a month. My expectations were greatly exceeded and I can’t wait to go back and visit!</p>

<p>When I first started traveling internationally most people suggested I visit London first (and I did). I would argue Bogota. Especially if you are working while you travel. Some basics to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weather - Bogota and London have very similar weather.</li>
  <li>Flights - The cost can be very inexpensive. Depending on where you’re located it could also be a much shorter flight.</li>
  <li>Time zone - They are on Eastern Time (or one hour behind depending on the time of year).</li>
  <li>Exchange rate - You will get so much more for you money in Bogota where the US dollar is strong compared to London where it’s not.</li>
  <li>Extremely affordable to get to warmer weather - Should you want to get a little sun and do more outdoor activities on the weekends or even during your work week the flights to surrounding areas are the cost of a taxi in the States.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I didn’t expect and was pleasantly surprised by is the amount of art and culture present in the city. The La Candelaria district is full of amazing museums, architecture, and great food. So when you want to break away from work and see the sites you have plenty of options.</p>

<p>I enjoyed some of the best meals, foods, and cocktails of my life in Bogota. There is a wide range of restaurants to choose from. Whether you’re in the mood for local cuisine, North American, Vietnamese, Italian, or just about anything else you can think of, you’ll find it easily in Bogota.</p>

<p>Beyond my own remote working experience, I found out the startup market is also very strong. While I was there a large FinTech innovator summit, <a href="http://www.finnovista.com/event/bogota/">Finnovista</a>, was held and sold out before I could buy a ticket. With universities practically on every corner, the talent pool is great. There aren’t many incubators. What you won’t easily find are founders who are willing to trade money and expertise for a stake in their company. This is a country that has had too much taken from them for too long.</p>

<p>If you are an investor the real estate market is where people and companies are investing.  Specifically, low-income and student housing where there is a great shortage and demands are high. <a href="https://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/overview/building-roof-real-estate-development-continues-mirror-country%E2%80%99s-economic-stability">The Oxford Business Group</a> explains why the real estate market remains steady.</p>

<p>During my time there I could definitely feel how Bogota is emerging and my thoughts and views on the city have been completed changed. I didn’t feel unsafe. I never walked around scared and explored the city on my own regularly. It’s not only a great place to work remotely, but also a great destination for vacationing. I will definitely be back.</p>
